In 2010, OPS founder Leo Szeto realized that many Electrical Engineering students at UCLA were dissatisfied with the lack of hands-on projects opportunities offered by the school. Taking matters into his own hands, Leo founded the IEEE at UCLA Open Project Space, a program designed to teach fledgling Electrical Engineering students a suite of essential hardware and software skills through biweekly lectures and fun, hands-on mini projects. Over the past decade, OPS has grown and expanded to include a set of 10 diverse mini-projects and a culminating Capstone project.  
OPS remains a cornerstone of IEEE at UCLA, attracting and teaching over 100 new members every year.

Now, we are launching OPS 2.0, a program that aims to bring the hardware engineering projects of IEEE at UCLA to collegiate engineering organizations throughout the world. Just as OPS has been pivotal in growing IEEE at UCLA, we hope that by offering our OPS curriculum and some of our club's best practices, you can find success!
