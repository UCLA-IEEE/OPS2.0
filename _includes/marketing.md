OPS 2.0 aims to bring the hardware engineering projects of IEEE at UCLA to collegiate engineering organizations throughout the world. Just as OPS has been pivotal in growing IEEE at UCLA, we hope that by offering our OPS curriculum and some of our club's best practices, you can find success!

Here is a list of resources that the OPS2.0 program offers:

- A set of tried and true lecture slides and project specs that have been tested and fine-tuned over years of UCLA's OPS program
- A detailed guide to actually running a projects program - from budgeting, to hosting events, to giving lectures and more
- Personal guidance from our team of veteran project leads
- Marketing materials to aid with member recruitment
- Potential funding to help kickstart your program

As of April 2024, we have successfully launched the OPS program at over 15 universities. We hope you'll be next!
