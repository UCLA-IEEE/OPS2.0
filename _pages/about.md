In 2010, OPS founder Leo Szeto realized that many Electrical Engineering students at UCLA were dissatisfied with the lack of hands-on projects opportunities offered by the school. Taking matters into his own hands, Leo founded the IEEE at UCLA Open Project Space, a program designed to teach fledgling Electrical Engineering students a suite of essential hardware and software skills through biweekly lectures and fun, hands-on mini projects. Over the past decade, OPS has grown and expanded to include a set of 10 diverse mini-projects and a culminating Capstone project.
OPS remains a cornerstone of IEEE at UCLA, attracting and teaching over 100 new members every year.
